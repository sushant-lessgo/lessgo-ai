For your landing page builder, you should define all background styles using **static Tailwind classes for structure** (like `bg-gradient-to-r`, `from-[var(--bg-from)]`, `to-[var(--bg-to)]`, `bg-[radial-gradient(...)]`, `blur-[160px]`) and feed the **actual colors** through **CSS variables** at runtime. This way, Tailwind always sees the class names at build time, ensuring they’re included in the generated CSS, while the color values — whether from your prebuilt `bgVariations` or a user’s color picker — remain fully dynamic without bloating your CSS or requiring a huge safelist. This is the same approach mature builders like Webflow and Framer use to handle infinite color and gradient combinations efficiently.
