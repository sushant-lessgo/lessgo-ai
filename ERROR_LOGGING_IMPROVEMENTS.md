# Error Logging Improvements for 2-Phase Generation

## Problem Solved
The 2-phase generation was failing with empty error objects `{}`, making debugging impossible. The system would fall back to single-phase generation without providing any useful error information.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Main Error Logging (Line 522-548)
- **Detailed Error Context**: Captures error message, name, stack trace, and type
- **Error Classification**: Automatically categorizes errors by type and severity
- **Contextual Information**: Logs store states, layout requirements, and data integrity
- **Recovery Suggestions**: Provides specific guidance based on error type
- **Development Mode**: Full error object logging in development environment

### 2. Step-by-Step Operation Logging (Lines 143-234)
Added detailed logging for each critical Phase 1 operation:

#### Step 1: Input Validation (Lines 143-157)
- Validates onboardingStore and pageStore existence
- Checks for required layout.sections data
- Logs validation results with context

#### Step 2: Elements Map Generation (Lines 159-175)
- Wraps `getCompleteElementsMap()` call in try-catch
- Logs success with processed sections count
- Provides specific error details if elements map generation fails

#### Step 3: Strategy Prompt Building (Lines 189-205)
- Wraps `buildStrategyPrompt()` call in try-catch
- Logs prompt length and requirements
- Captures and reports prompt building failures

#### Step 4: AI Provider Call (Lines 214-234)
- Wraps `callAIProvider()` in try-catch
- Logs provider, model, success status
- Captures API call failures with context

### 3. Error Classification System (Lines 77-155)
Intelligent error categorization with:

#### Error Types:
- **validation**: Missing or invalid store data
- **schema**: Unified schema migration issues
- **ai_provider**: API connectivity and authentication issues
- **parsing**: Prompt building and response parsing failures
- **network**: Connectivity and timeout issues
- **unknown**: Unclassified errors

#### Severity Levels:
- **critical**: Schema migration issues
- **high**: Validation and parsing failures
- **medium**: AI provider and network issues
- **low**: Minor issues (not currently used)

#### Recovery Suggestions:
Each error type includes specific guidance for resolution.

### 4. Enhanced Fallback Error Logging (Lines 473-487)
- Improved fallback error handling with full context
- Links fallback errors to original error details
- Development mode logging for full error objects

## Usage

### Debug Environment Variables
Set these in `.env.local` for enhanced debugging:

```bash
DEBUG_AI_PROMPTS=true           # Log full AI prompts
DEBUG_AI_RESPONSES=true         # Log full AI responses
DEBUG_ELEMENT_SELECTION=true    # Log element selection details
```

### Log Output Format
Errors now appear with classification and severity:
```
‚ùå 2-phase generation failed [Schema Migration - CRITICAL]: {errorDetails}
üí° Recovery suggestion: Check unified schema migration and element determination logic
```

### Step-by-Step Logging
Each operation is now traceable:
```
üîç Step 1: Validating input data...
‚úÖ Input validation passed: {context}
üó∫Ô∏è Step 2: Generating complete elements map...
‚úÖ Elements map generated successfully: {details}
üìù Step 3: Building strategy prompt...
‚úÖ Strategy prompt built successfully: {info}
ü§ñ Step 4: Calling AI provider for strategy generation...
‚úÖ AI provider call completed: {results}
```

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Error Identification**: No more empty error objects
2. **Precise Failure Location**: Know exactly which step failed
3. **Contextual Debugging**: Full context about data state when error occurred
4. **Guided Recovery**: Specific suggestions for each error type
5. **Development Support**: Enhanced logging in development mode
6. **Production Safety**: Structured logging without exposing sensitive data

## Next Steps

When a 2-phase generation fails, check the logs for:
1. **Error Classification**: What type of error occurred
2. **Recovery Suggestion**: Follow the specific guidance provided
3. **Step Logging**: Identify which step failed
4. **Context Data**: Review store states and data integrity
5. **Stack Trace**: Use in development mode for deeper debugging

This comprehensive logging system should make debugging 2-phase generation failures straightforward and actionable.
