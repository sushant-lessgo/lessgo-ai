1. Below sections were generated

1. Hero - leftcopyrightimage - no card count requirement
2. MetricTiles - Features - The AI in first phase said 4 features and it gave 4 features so good... however in previous step user provided 6 feature list so that should also be considered. User has worked hard on a list including its priority
3. StackedHighlights UniqueMechanism - It needed cardcount but AI provided no guidance about this section.. Wrong
4. StatBlocks - result - AI gave recommendation for 3 cards but only one car came with weird data ["50%", "2.5x", "10,000+"].. may be issue at UIBlock level
5. BeforeAfterQuote- Testimonials - 2 pair of beforeafterpair came ( so 2 cards) but AI recommended 3 testimonials
6. YouvsThemHighlight - ComparisionTable - Here Cards will be always 2 as for format.... but real question is about number of lines in each card.. AI recommeded 3 but we got 6 and i am not sure the content generated from AI or default content. ex Hours wasted on manual tasks, Constant switching between tools
7. InlineQnAList - FAQ - AI suggested 5 FAQ but only 3 came
8. CenteredHeadlineCTA - primaryCTA - no card count requirement

Finally the AI in phase 1 gave card requirement for 3 more sections which were not even present
