Issue: the imagetoolbar is updating the **wrong key/section**. It parses and selects `sectionId: "beforeAfter"` with `elementKey: "1757310502405-persona_avatar"`, but the renderer extracts content for layout **PersonaJourney** and looks for a plain `"persona_avatar"` key. Because that key is absent, itâ€™s treated as undefined and falls back to the default `/persona-placeholder.jpg`.&#x20;
