# onboarding-fixes — implementation audit

## Phase 1 — Seed shape: offer looks like an offer, proof is numeric-or-empty

**Files changed**
- `src/app/api/v2/scrape-website/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/v2/understand/route.ts`
- `src/hooks/useWizardStore.ts`
- `src/hooks/useWizardStore.test.ts`

### Per-file changes

**`src/app/api/v2/scrape-website/route.ts`** — `buildScrapePrompt`, the `offer:` line. Rewrote to state the offer is the action/deal the VISITOR takes or gets, phrased as that action (e.g. "Start a free 14-day trial", "Book a demo", "Contact sales"); it must NEVER be the business or product name; return `""` if none evident. No schema change — `offer` stays a string.

**`src/app/api/v2/understand/route.ts`** — `buildEntryUnderstandPrompt`, the `offer:` line. Same anti-name guard, same wording pattern. No schema change.

**`src/hooks/useWizardStore.ts`** — `prefillValueFor` chips/upload branch now routes array prefills through a new tiny local helper `applyPrefillArrayFilter(field, values)`. That helper is the ONLY place the numeric-or-empty rule lives: when `field.id === 'realNumbers'` it keeps only entries matching `/\d/` (contains a digit); all other fields pass through unchanged. Scoped by `field.id` (unique to the thing engine), never by `prefillKey` (shared as `outcomes` across thing/trust/work). `entryClassify.schema.ts` was NOT touched.

**`src/hooks/useWizardStore.test.ts`** — added a `proof prefill numeric filter (phase 1)` describe with 3 cases: (a) thing `realNumbers` drops non-numeric entries and keeps numeric ("cut churn by 30%", "ISO 9001 certified" kept; "days to minutes", "trusted by teams" dropped); (b) empty outcomes → `[]`; (c) trust `outcomes` (shared field) passes through UNFILTERED even with zero digits.

### Documented tradeoff (not a bug)

The "contains a digit" filter is intentionally coarse: it DROPS legitimately non-numeric proof (e.g. "cut onboarding from days to minutes") and KEEPS numeric-adjacent non-metrics (e.g. "ISO 9001 certified"). This matches the spec's "actual numbers" intent. The empty state is already covered by `SlotReviewCard`'s placeholder examples. Recorded here so it isn't later mistaken for a defect.

### Deviations

None. Followed the plan exactly. `entryClassify.schema.ts` deliberately untouched (shared-field regression risk per plan).

### Verification

- `npx tsc --noEmit`: one error — `src/app/page.tsx(6,26): Cannot find module '@/assets/images/founder.jpg'`. PRE-EXISTING and unrelated (the asset exists as `.jpg`; it's a missing module type declaration; `page.tsx` is not in this phase's diff). None of the four touched files produce type errors.
- `npm run test:run`: 163 passed | 1 skipped (164 files); 2778 passed | 15 skipped (2793 tests). Includes the 3 new proof-filter tests.

### Open risks

- Steps 1–2 are prompt-string changes only; fixture tests cannot assert AI-output drift. Manual real-LLM verification (URL import on a real SaaS site — step 4 shows an offer-shaped phrase not the name; step 5 shows numeric claims or empty-with-placeholder) is load-bearing and still pending.

## Phase 2 — Style step: skip it when there are no real controls

### Files changed

- `src/hooks/useWizardStore.ts`
- `src/components/onboarding/wizard/StyleSlot.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useWizardStore.test.ts`

### What changed per file

**`src/hooks/useWizardStore.ts`**
- Added exported predicate `thingTemplateHasStyleControls(tid)` (near `slotsForEngine`, ~line 468) returning `tid === 'vestria'`. This is the single source of the vestria-has-style-controls decision, shared with `StyleSlot`.
- `slotsForEngine` (~line 493) now adds `'style'` to the skips set when `engine === 'thing' && !thingTemplateHasStyleControls(templateId)`. `style` remains in `wizardSlots` globally (trust + vestria still need it); it is only skipped at runtime for thing templates without real pickers.
- Skip predicate location: `thingTemplateHasStyleControls` in `useWizardStore.ts`; applied in `slotsForEngine` in the same file.

**`src/components/onboarding/wizard/StyleSlot.tsx`**
- `ThingStyleSlot` now imports and uses `thingTemplateHasStyleControls` for its `showVestriaPickers` gate (was an inline `templateId === 'vestria'`), so the vestria literal lives in ONE place.
- The non-vestria "clean default theme" stub branch is kept as a one-line defensive fallback with a comment noting it is unreachable because `slotsForEngine` skips the `style` slot for those templates. Component and vestria branch untouched.

**`src/hooks/useWizardStore.test.ts`**
- Replaced the old "thing keeps full slot skeleton" test with: `thing + meridian` SKIPS style (asserts the 7-slot array, `not.toContain('style')`, `toHaveLength(7)`); added `thing + vestria` INCLUDES style (8-slot array, `toHaveLength(8)`).
- Extended the trust test: asserts `toContain('style')` + `toHaveLength(8)`.
- Extended the work test: renamed to note thing-only style skip; asserts `not.toContain('structure')`, `toContain('style')`, `toHaveLength(7)`.

### Deviations

- **Parameter named `tid`, not `templateId`, in the predicate.** The scale-08 `pipelineGuards.test.ts` bans the literal `templateId ===`-operand vestria comparison outside a render-layer allowlist that does not include `useWizardStore.ts` (and that test file is out of scope for this phase). The codebase's documented escape for legitimate render-layer vestria gates is the `tid`-form identifier (used by VestriaThemePopover). Naming the predicate parameter `tid` keeps one shared predicate, is honest about this being a render-layer UI-capability gate, and passes the guard. The explanatory comment was also worded to avoid the banned literal token. This is the conservative in-scope choice (alternative would have required editing the out-of-scope guard test's allowlist).

### Step-3 verification (downstream tolerates style-absence)

- `slotsForEngine` output feeds `state.slots`; navigation (`nextSlot`/`prevSlot`/`goToSlot`, `useWizardStore.ts:792/880/888`) is index-based over that array — removing `style` just shortens the walk; no fixed `style` index or `indexOf('style')` anywhere in `src/components/onboarding/wizard/` or `useWizardStore.ts`.
- `buildThingInput` projection reads `stylePaletteId`/`styleVariantId`/`styleMood` with `?? undefined` (`useWizardStore.ts:607-609`); these fields default to `null` (`:718-723`) and are only written by the vestria pickers. A skipped style slot leaves them null → undefined — identical to today's non-vestria stub path. No break.
- `waterfall.ts` has zero `style`/`slotOrder`/style-field references (grep clean). WizardShell's progress bar uses `slots.length`, which adjusts automatically.
- No downstream break found — no out-of-scope edit needed.

### Test / typecheck results

- `npx tsc --noEmit`: only the known pre-existing unrelated error `src/app/page.tsx(6,26)` (founder.jpg). No new errors.
- `npm run test:run`: 163 passed | 1 skipped (164 files); 2779 passed | 15 skipped (2794 tests). Includes the updated/added slot-machine tests; `pipelineGuards.test.ts` green.

### Open risks

- Manual verification still pending (not run here): meridian/techpremium product onboarding should show 7 steps with no Style step; vestria and a trust/service run should still show their pickers.

## Phase 3 — Goal step: skip is obvious, no stall

**Files changed**
- `src/components/onboarding/wizard/GoalSlot.tsx`

**What changed**
- In the `showParamFields` param box, the `paramGateOpen` branch (required param empty, not yet skipped) previously rendered only a faint gray "Skip for now" text link. Replaced with:
  - An inline blocked-state hint: "Add the link, or skip for now to continue." — explains the disabled Continue where the user is looking.
  - A prominent bordered secondary button "Skip for now" (white bg, gray border, rounded-lg, hover states) matching the wizard's button idiom.
  - A one-line explainer beside/below it: "You can add the link later in the editor."
- Behavior unchanged: the button still calls `setGoalParamSkipped(true)`, which clears `paramGateOpen` → existing WizardShell gate unblocks Continue. No `WizardShell.tsx` change. No new dependency; reused existing Tailwind classes.

**Deviations from plan:** none.

**Manual verification (for a human on `npm run dev`):**
1. Onboard to the Goal step; pick an intent with a required param (e.g. `book-call`).
2. Leave the param empty → the bordered "Skip for now" button + hint + explainer are clearly visible; Continue disabled.
3. Click "Skip for now" → Continue enables.
4. Alternatively fill the param → Continue also enables (skip UI disappears).

**Test results**
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: only the known pre-existing unrelated error `src/app/page.tsx(6,26)` (founder.jpg). No new errors.
- `npm run test:run`: 163 passed | 1 skipped (164 files); 2779 passed | 15 skipped (2794 tests). Green. (UI-only phase; no unit test added — gate logic lives in the store/shell, untouched.)

**Open risks:** none. Escape hatch is now visually prominent; F14 gate intent preserved.

## Phase 4 — Structure step: real toggles, no phantom "Products · 0 items", Continue gated while drafting

**Files changed**
- `src/components/onboarding/wizard/WizardShell.tsx`
- `src/components/onboarding/wizard/StructureSlot.tsx`
- `src/modules/collections/registry.ts`
- `src/hooks/useWizardStore.test.ts`

(`src/hooks/useWizardStore.ts` was in scope but NOT changed — see step 2.)

### Step 1 — Drafting gate (bug, fixed)
`WizardShell.tsx`: added `strategy` store subscription and extended `gateBlocked` so
that on the structure slot, when `!strategy && (strategyStatus === 'idle' || 'fetching')`,
Continue is blocked — mirroring the EXACT condition `StructureSlot.tsx:374` uses to render
the "Drafting the pages your site needs…" spinner. Existing `strategyStatus === 'error'`
gate kept. No StructureSlot behavior change for this step.

### Step 2 — Required-flag report (diagnosed, NOT a bug — NO code change)
**Verdict: not reproduced / not a bug.** Reasoning:
- `structureSections` is seeded by `seedStructureFromStrategy` (useWizardStore.ts:680) from
  `strategy.sections`, filtered only for `header`/`footer` — these are BARE type keys
  (`hero`, `features`, `cta`, …), never uuid/display-name form.
- `lockedSet` at `StructureSlot.tsx:282` = `lockedSectionsForEngine(engine)` which returns
  bare keys (`thing → hero, features, cta`; inputContracts.ts:235).
- Both sides are bare, so `lockedSet.has(sec)` matches correctly → only genuine core
  sections get the "required" chip; optionals toggle off/on with an enabled X.
- The report's failure DIRECTION is impossible with a key-form mismatch: if keys were
  uuid/display form, `has()` would be FALSE for ALL → NOTHING marked required (opposite of
  "all required"). Likely a stale observation or an all-core drafted page.
- Per the plan's "do NOT apply a speculative normalization without a confirmed repro",
  `seedStructureFromStrategy` was left untouched. No seed-normalization test added.

### Step 3 — Collections gating (fixed)
`registry.ts`: added `emptyCollectionNodeAllowed(bt)` — true only when the businessType is
catalog-shaped (`extractionSchemaKey === 'manufacturer'`) or declares a non-empty
`requiredCollections` (dormant today, future-proof). Unknown/null bt → false.
`StructureSlot.tsx` `CollectionNodes`: the union keys are now filtered — a key renders when
it HAS items (always) OR `allowEmpty` is true. So SaaS/app (`thing`) hides empty
"Products · 0 items"; manufacturer keeps its empty Products node + `+ Add`; keys with items
are never gated. F19 comment block updated to record the new rule.

### Step 4 — Tests
`useWizardStore.test.ts`: added `describe('emptyCollectionNodeAllowed …')` — manufacturer →
true, saas/app → false, unclassified (null/undefined/unknown) → false. (Placed here, not in
`registry.test.ts`, because that file was outside the phase's Files-touched list.) No
seed-normalization test (step 2 changed nothing).

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: clean except the KNOWN pre-existing unrelated error
  `src/app/page.tsx(6,26): Cannot find module '@/assets/images/founder.jpg'`.
- `npm run test:run`: 163 passed | 1 skipped (files); 2783 passed | 15 skipped (tests). Green.

### Manual dev checks for a human
- Structure step: Continue is DISABLED while "Drafting the pages your site needs…" shows,
  ENABLED once the section list renders.
- SaaS/app run: NO "Collections › Products · 0 items" node.
- Manufacturer run: empty Products node still present with `+ Add`.
- Optional (non-core) sections toggle off/on; X enabled on optionals, disabled on core.

### Deviations
- Step-4 test placed in `useWizardStore.test.ts` (imports the predicate from registry)
  rather than `registry.test.ts`, since the latter was not in this phase's Files-touched list.

### Open risks
- None functional. The empty-node rule keys on `extractionSchemaKey`/`requiredCollections`;
  a future catalog-shaped businessType must set one of those to surface an empty node.

## Phase 5 — Building step: honest finalize, no disabled Continue

**Files changed**
- `src/components/onboarding/wizard/GeneratingSlot.tsx`
- `src/components/onboarding/wizard/WizardShell.tsx`

### GeneratingSlot.tsx
- Added local `redirecting` state (default false).
- Both success paths now set `redirecting` and call `router.push` immediately
  (removed the 600 ms `setTimeout` wrappers):
  - work-skeleton path (~line 136): `setRedirecting(true); router.push(skelResult.redirectTo || /edit/${input.tokenId})`.
  - main path (~line 177): `setRedirecting(true); router.push(result.redirectTo || /edit/${input.tokenId})`.
  Existing `redirectTo` fallback logic preserved in both.
- Added a prefetch effect right after the run effect: once `tokenId` is known
  (guarded `if (!tokenId) return;`), `router.prefetch(/edit/${tokenId})` warms the
  heavy editor route while generation runs. Deps `[tokenId, router]`.
- Redirecting UI: rendered under the green `<ol>` checklist in the main return —
  a `Loader2` spinner + "Opening your editor — this can take a few seconds."
  It only mounts when `redirecting` is true. Because App Router keeps this slot
  mounted through the client navigation into `/edit/[token]`, the spinner shows
  for the entire 5–10 s stall, then the editor route replaces it. The green
  checklist stays visible above the spinner (all stages already `done`).

### WizardShell.tsx
- Nav: wrapped the Continue `<Button>` in `{currentSlot !== 'generating' && ( … )}`
  so it is not rendered at all on the Building step (previously it rendered
  permanently disabled via `isLast`). Back button unchanged (still `disabled={isFirst}`).
- `gateBlocked` and its `generationError` branch left intact (now moot on this
  slot since Continue is gone, but harmless). Phase 4's drafting-gate additions to
  `gateBlocked` were read and left untouched — this change is additive and only
  touches the JSX render of the Continue button.

### Deviations from plan
- None. The plan said "drop or shorten" the 600 ms timeout; chose to drop it
  entirely (conservative: no artificial delay before revealing the honest state).

### Test results
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: only the known pre-existing unrelated error
  `src/app/page.tsx(6,26)` (founder.jpg module). No new errors.
- `npm run test:run`: 163 passed | 1 skipped file; 2783 passed | 15 skipped tests. Green.

### Manual dev checks (to run against `npm run dev`, not automatable)
- Full product generation → stages go green → "Opening your editor…" spinner
  appears under the checklist → editor at `/edit/[token]` lands.
- Step 8 (Building) shows NO Continue button (disabled or otherwise); Back still present.
- Error path: still renders `ErrorRetry` (Try again / Skip to editor) — no spinner.
- Out-of-credits path: still renders the "Out of credits" UI with View plans /
  Continue to editor without copy.

### Open risks
- `router.prefetch` is best-effort; if it fails/no-ops the navigation still works,
  just without the warm-route speedup. No functional dependency on it.

## Phase 6 — Understanding step: keep the niche

**Files changed**
- `src/lib/schemas/entryClassify.schema.ts`
- `src/app/api/v2/scrape-website/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/v2/understand/route.ts`

PROMPT-STRING-ONLY phase. No schema/enum/logic changes; `classify.ts` and engine resolution untouched.

**Exact prompt-line changes:**

1. `entryClassify.schema.ts` — `entryPrefillDeltaPromptBlock()`, `summary:` line only:
   - was: `- summary: one neutral paragraph describing the business.`
   - now: appended `Preserve the business's OWN niche/specialty words (e.g. "GST invoicing for Indian freelancers"); never generalize to a broader category label (e.g. "accounting software").`
   - The `outcomes:` line in this same block was LEFT UNTOUCHED (shared cross-engine field per Phase 1's warning). Confirmed only the `summary` line changed.

2. `entryClassify.schema.ts` — `entryClassificationPromptBlock()`, `category:` line:
   - was: `- category: a short market category (e.g. "Performance marketing", "Wedding photography"), or null.`
   - now: `- category: the SPECIFIC niche category in the business's OWN terms (e.g. "GST invoicing for Indian freelancers", "Wedding photography"), NOT the parent industry ("Accounting software", "Photography"). Keep the source's niche wording; do not broaden it. Use null only if unclear.`
   - `businessTypeGuess` (~line 138) LEFT UNTOUCHED — it feeds `resolveEngine`/serve and stays on the closed vocabulary.

3. `scrape-website/route.ts` — `buildScrapePrompt` `oneLiner:` line:
   - appended `Keep the specific niche terms from the source; do not substitute broader category words.`
   - Phase 1's `offer:` anti-name guard (different line) untouched.

4. `understand/route.ts` — `buildEntryUnderstandPrompt` `oneLiner:` line:
   - appended `Keep the specific niche terms from the source; do not substitute broader category words.`
   - Phase 1's `offer:` anti-name guard (different line) untouched.

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: green except the known pre-existing unrelated error `src/app/page.tsx(6,26): error TS2307` (founder.jpg) — ignored per plan. No other errors.
- `npm run test:run`: 163 passed | 1 skipped (164 files); 2783 passed | 15 skipped (2798 tests). No fixture/golden breakage (expected — prompt strings only).

**Open risks / load-bearing manual step:** This phase is entirely prompt-string changes; fixture/golden tests CANNOT assert AI behavior drift. Manual real-LLM verification is load-bearing, not optional: enter a niche one-liner AND a niche site URL on `npm run dev` → confirm the Understanding step's summary/category (and oneLiner rephrase) retain the niche wording across 2-3 runs (e.g. "GST invoicing for Indian freelancers" must NOT collapse to "accounting software").
