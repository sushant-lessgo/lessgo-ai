Check should be on completeness only which is objective

1. All the fields should be in layoutElementSchema.ts
2. All the optional fields should have a way to picked up in selectOptionalElement.ts
3. All the fields should be part of fieldClassfication.ts classification
4. All the fields that are marked as AI generated should be part of buildPrompt.ts
5. All the fields generated by AI should be passed to UIBlocks in the format in which they expect after parseAIresponse.ts

## Example: InlineQnAList Completion

**Initial State:** 2.5/5 - Major gaps in schema and field handling
**Final State:** 5/5 - Complete architectural integration

### Issues Found & Fixed:

**‚ùå layoutElementSchema.ts:** Missing 13 of 16 fields
**‚úÖ Fixed:** Added all individual Q&A fields (question_1-6, answer_1-6) + subheadline + legacy fields

**‚ùå selectOptionalElements.ts:** Referenced non-existent 'introduction_text'
**‚úÖ Fixed:** Updated to 'subheadline' + added progressive Q&A rules based on market sophistication

**‚ùå fieldClassification.ts:** No explicit classification
**‚úÖ Fixed:** Added `classifyInlineQnAListField()` with AI-generated classification for all fields

**‚úÖ buildPrompt.ts:** Already had proper prompt guidance

**‚ùå parseAIresponse.ts:** No specific format handling
**‚úÖ Fixed:** Added `processInlineQnAListContent()` with dual format support + Q&A pair validation

**üìù Bonus:** Updated component meta contentFields to match actual implementation

### Key Learnings:
- Schema completeness is foundational - missing fields break the entire pipeline
- Dual format support requires specialized parsing logic
- Field classification should be explicit rather than relying on generic patterns
- Component meta should accurately reflect actual field structure
