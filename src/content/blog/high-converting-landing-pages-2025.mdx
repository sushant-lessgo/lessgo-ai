# No-Code, AI, or Freelancers? 4 Ways to Build a High-Converting Landing Page in 2025

_Pros, Cons, and What to Choose as a Founder in 2025_

Building a landing page in 2025 should be easy.  
But if you’re a solo founder, strapped for time, budget, or writing/design skills — the options can feel overwhelming.

Do you go old-school and hire a freelancer or agency? Tinker endlessly with no-code tools? Or trust the shiny new AI-powered page generators?

In this post, we break down the **4 real ways founders are building landing pages today** — with an honest look at pros, cons, and which approach actually helps you launch and convert faster.

## 1. Hire Freelancers (Design + Dev + Copywriter)

### ✅ Pros:
- Fully custom design
- Deep expertise (if you can afford it)
- Tailored to your brand

### ❌ Cons:
- Slow (weeks or even months)
- Expensive ($500–$5000+)
- Requires detailed briefs, back-and-forth

### 💡 Best for:
Well-funded teams, or startups with complex brand needs from day one.

## 2. No-Code Tools  
_Examples: Carrd, Webflow, Unicorn Platform_

### ✅ Pros:
- Quick to launch
- Affordable (or free)
- Great for visual thinkers

### ❌ Cons:

Makers with time, an eye for design, and decent writing instincts.

## 3. AI Design-Focused Builders  
_Examples: Mixo, Durable, etc._

- Good for MVP landing pages

### ❌ Cons:
