STRATEGIC ANALYSIS REQUIRED:

1. **Copy Strategy Foundation:**
   - Big Idea/Hook: What's the one compelling concept that stops the scroll and drives everything?
   - Core Promise: What transformation are we selling? (from pain state to desired outcome)
   - Unique Mechanism: Why does this work when alternatives fail? What's the "secret sauce"?
   - Primary Emotional Trigger: What emotion drives this audience to action? (fear, desire, status, etc.)
   - Objection Priority: What are the top 3 barriers to conversion in order of importance?

2. **Card Count Strategy:**
   For each section, determine the optimal number of cards based on:
   - Market sophistication level and proof requirements
   - Audience awareness level and education needs
   - Available evidence strength and credibility
   - Objection intensity and coverage needed
   - Conversion psychology for this specific audience

   DETERMINE CARD COUNTS FOR:
   - Features: How many feature cards needed to prove complete value proposition?
   - Testimonials: How many customer stories needed for sufficient credibility?
   - FAQ: How many questions to remove the major objections?
   - Results/Stats: How many metrics needed to build strong belief?
   - Social Proof: How many trust elements needed for market credibility?
   - Pricing (if applicable): How many pricing tiers or value points?
   - Problem: How many pain points to establish urgency?
   - Comparison: How many comparison points to show superiority?

STRATEGIC REASONING REQUIRED:
- Explain WHY each card count is optimal for THIS specific business and audience
- Consider evidence strength: strong proof = fewer cards, weak proof = more accumulation
- Factor in market sophistication: sophisticated buyers need more comprehensive proof
- Address objection coverage: ensure all major barriers are addressed

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON object with this exact structure:

{
  "copyStrategy": {
    "bigIdea": "The central compelling hook that drives everything",
    "corePromise": "Specific transformation from current state to desired outcome",
    "uniqueMechanism": "Why this works when alternatives fail",
    "primaryEmotion": "Main emotional driver for this audience",
    "objectionPriority": ["primary_objection", "secondary_objection", "tertiary_objection"]
  },
  "cardCounts": {
    "features": 4,
    "testimonials": 3,
    "faq": 5,
    "results": 3,
    "social_proof": 4,
    "pricing": 3,

  }
}

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Base card counts on PERSUASION NECESSITY, not arbitrary limits
- Consider this specific audience's skepticism level and proof requirements
- Factor in the strength of available evidence (strong proof = fewer cards needed)
- Ensure sufficient objection coverage without overwhelming the prospect
- Remember: the goal is conversion, not content volume

Analyze this business and return the strategic foundation for high-converting copy generation.`;
